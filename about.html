			<p> This is a website, and that's a picture of me! Hello world! I made this website in 2018 to document my summer and the things I did that year, but I was originally assigned this as  <a href="project.html"> a project for school </a></p>

			<h3> Why Little Fictions? </h3>
				<p> I'm sure you're wondering why I picked such an unrelated name for my website, I decided on "Little Fictions" for a multitude of reasons, some more complex than others:</p>
					<ul>
						<li> I had decided to start building my website and soon found that I needed a name for it. As I'm not exactly the best with names, I fired up Spotify and started listening to <a target=_blank href="https://open.spotify.com/track/211ySF5QttJs4TLFLRYmF4">"Firebrand and Angel" by Elbow;</a> thinking that it was such a good song, I decided to listen to the album, "Little Fictions". The title song played and I was transported to another world.I had nothing else to name my website, so I mostly used it as a placeholder at first, being so intrigued by the song. While trying thinking of new names, I instead found a reason to keep it.</li>

						<br>

						<li> I felt that the name "Little Fictions" was sort of indicitive of my summer, being full of little fictions. In a more literal sense, the project that I chose for myself was to write a collection of short stories, which are in essence, little fictions. </li>
					</ul>
