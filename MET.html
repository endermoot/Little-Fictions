					<h2> My Internship at the MET </h2>

			</div>

		<!-- Text -->
		<div class="text">
			<p> Early in 2018, I applied for an internship with at the MET over the summer and was delighted to find out that I was accepted in late May. The program consisted of different parts spanning from July 10th to August 10th. Our first time all together was on June 8th for our orientation with our families which gave us all an opportunity to ask questions as what we would be doing over the course of the internship. The next week we had our “boot camp”, where we got to know each other by doing all sorts of different activities including a scavenger hunt around the museum and a game where we had to remember the names of everyone before us in a circle. </p>

			<h3> What was it? </h3>

				<p> The main part of our internship was the departmental placement, where we were assigned a mentor in one of the 17 departments of the MET. I was put into the education department with seven other talented individuals. Our group of eight, alongside our mentor Jaqueline Cedar was tasked with planning the next Teens Take the MET! activity, this upcoming fall. </p>

			<h3> What I expected </h3>

				<p> My experience at the museum was—at least initially—much different than what I expected. I thought that I’d be pushing buttons, passing along papers or some sort of menial task most of the day, yet when we got to work here at the museum, I discovered that I was wrong and that my internship wouldn’t be as mundane as sitting behind a desk all day. Our mentor and all other museum staff didn’t treat us like we were kids, but with respect, I truly felt like we were equals. </p>

			<h3> Departmental Placement </h3>

				<p> During our first week, we spent the majority of our time studying art materials. We would go around the various galleries and draw (or in my case attempt to draw) the statues in different ways using different methods. I didn’t really understand at the time, but we were put into the shoes of potential guests to a museum’s teen event. The following week we started brainstorming and refining what our activity would be. We came up with all sorts of ideas and we all helped each other build upon them. I was genuinely surprised to find everyone so open to ideas and changes to their projects and providing feedback on each other’s work. </p>

			<h3> Career Labs </h3>

				<p> In addition to all of this, we met with museum employees during another phase of the internship, career labs. Our career labs were an opportunity for everyone in the program (regardless of departmental placement) to learn more about the museum and its staff including what their job is, how they got to the museum and much more. During the first hour the museum employees would sit in a panel of usually around 5. Jeary Payne, the man in charge of our internship would start off by asking a few questions where afterwards the floor would open for anyone to make inquiries. Afterwards, we would break off into smaller groups headed by some of the panelist who would lead an activity pertaining to their role in the museum. Some of the panelists who came in were from the MET’s library, digital, marketing and curators. Our third career lab differed from the others, as the college interns helped explain and guide us through some of the college process. Our mentor was also able to bring in other museum staff throughout the course of our second week, including a curator from the costume institute as well as the person who writes the MET timeline for artifacts on the website. All of these individuals gave us insight as to how different roles all come together to make one beautiful institution. </p>

				<p> I feel that I accomplished much in my time at the MET, as brief as it was. I’ve learned how to organize an event from start to finish, see things in the bigger picture, contribute to a team and I’ve even discovered a lot about myself. I learned not to take myself for granted and I’ve finally seen that I’m capable of so much more than I thought I could be. </p>
