			<h2> My Summer Project </h2>
				<p class="date"> June 26th-September 5th </p>

			<h3> Original Plans </h3>
				<p> When first tasked with picking a summer project for my Software Engineering class, I thought that studying aerodynamics and aerodynamics would be interesting. I soon after created a requirements document for it and decided that I would write a research paper that would be followed by a virtual representation of a wind tunnel on <a target="_blank" href="https://scratch.mit.edu/">Scratch.</a> Soon after starting my research however, I found that I wasn't as passionate about the topic as I'd hoped. </p>

			<h3> New Requirements </h3>
				<p> After pondering on what to do for some time, I decided that I should do something that I'm passionate about. I remember thinking how I wanted to write more during the school year, so that's exactly what I made my project about. </p>

				<p> With a brand new topic meant a new set of requirements needed to be written. Although I wanted to tap into my creative writing side, I also wanted to do something more productive at the same time, so I chose to incorperate that into my project. The requirements I wrote had two major parts: to write 4 or more short stories accompanied by a draft of my college essay.</p>
