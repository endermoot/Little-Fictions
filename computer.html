			<h3> Shopping for Parts </h3>
				<p> I've been wanting to build my own PC for a while and I figured that this summer would be the perfect time to do so; I would finally get the money to make a good gaming build and I had more than enough time. </p>

				<p> I spent the majority of the early summer researching what parts to get and how to shop for them. I used <a target="_blank" href="https://www.newegg.com/"> Newegg.com </a> to find and compare what parts to buy. I already had a rough idea of what I needed/wanted, which definitely helped. I already had an Nvidia GeForce 1060 3GB from an upgrade I did on my old PC with a Corsair PSU from that same upgrade to accompany it. From there, it was mostly about getting a good CPU and Motherboard. </p>

				<h4> CPU </h4>
					<p> For whatever reason, I lean towards Intel when it comes to CPUs, maybe it's because their products are (marginally) more simple to shop for than AMD's. With that said, I began to look at the Kaby Lake class of processors because it somehow rung a bell... After looking around, I also discovered Intel's newest line of CPU's, Coffee Lake, or Generation 8. I then had two big decisions to make: the first being which generation to buy and whether or not to get an i5 or i7. </p>

					<p>As the gen 8 processors boast two more cores than Kaby Lakes four, I decided to go for them. Although most games don't utilize more than 2 cores, bigger AAA games are looking into it, I wanted to future-proof this thing as much as I could. Now, I was left on which class of processor to get; as i7 was more than I needed and cost more than I had, the i5 line seemed the most logical. I eventually settled on the i5-8600k as it's overclocking capability was very lucrative to me. From there, I spent the rest of my time finding compatable parts.</p>

			<h3> The Actual Building Process </h3>
				<p> Since I skipped out on helping build the computer's in our class, I was left pretty clueless. In my search for a tutorial video, I found one by <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhX0fOUYd8Q"> Bitwit </a>and followed along while building. The <em> majority </em> of my build was pretty standard and quite unremarkable; I installed the CPU with no problems, applied the thermal paste a-ok, everything was going great. Until I had to install the CPU cooler. </p>

				<p> For whatever reason, I just could not comprehend that LGA 115x was meant for my processor, as the chip set is 1151. It took me about 30 minutes to realize that the x was a variable (which would explain my regents scores...) After I finally figured out how to set the base, for whatever reason, one of the screws just would not go down, I couldn't put it in. I pressed down the cooler, I even had to slide it around a bit (I had the thermal paste, don't scream). At this point I was panicking, regretting literally every life decision I had ever made up to that point. About half an hour later, I realized I had it the wrong way around. Oops. </p>

				<p> After the cooler, the rest of my build was pretty boring. Nothing happened, and I was happy with that. In total, it took me about 5 hours to do everything, after the incident before, I was taking my time with <em>everything</em>. If you'd like a full list of my parts, you can find them <a href="https://pcpartpicker.com/list/YRBDnH"> here</a>, just add a generic monitor and Windows (if that counts).</p>

			<h3> Performance </h3>
				<p> I'm sure you're probably wonder how this thing fairs up against the games I built it for, and I must say that I can't complain. Right now, I have the CPU overclocked to 13.9% and I can play Battlefield 1 on the higher settings and still get 60 FPS with the occasional drop due to lag spikes. I run The Witcher 3, War Thunder and Overwatch all on max settings with absolutely no problems; but even more impressively, I can run Minecraft on a whopping <strong> 1,000+ FPS.</strong> Intense. </p>
